
Another example are the sections that will be given a direction, meaning upstream and downstream. The downstream direction is computed starting from the Source.

In NetCon, a production facility is called 'Factory'. Factories have a Role that is both a Source and Producer. Sources are marked with a role 'Source' during the extraction, see also [NetCon base extraction for Smallworld](Upstream%2520and%2520Downstream%2520sections%2520model.md##netcon-base-extraction-for-smallworld).

Of course, for many network the flow is actually unknown or it may reverse occasionally.
As if we are used to networks from the previous century, this fact is ignored and we still talk about downstream (travelling from central production to consumers or service points) or upstream (travelling up to central production facility.)

The configuration of custom sections is explained in [Section Model configuration](Upstream%2520and%2520Downstream%2520sections%2520model.md##section-model-configuration).

E.g. the priority-sections for service connections for Risc-based Asset Management.
