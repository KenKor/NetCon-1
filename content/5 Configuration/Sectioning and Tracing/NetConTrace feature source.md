# NetConTrace feature source

This feature source needs to be configured to enable the NetCon 2.0 sectioning and tracing. 
Both the tracing and section take the same input [[../../6 Use/DataModel/NetCon Connection|NetCon Connection]]s.

After loading, which time is dependent on the speed of the database and the number of connections, tracing is available.
Depending on the settings below, the feature source will cluster/section the network into Isolatable and Operated Sections, as well as Control and Custom sections.

#ToDo Write more.

(\*) Note that these items still need to be implemented.

The predicates in the the table mentioned above can take wildcards just as the filter expressions passed to the reduction functions and API. These predicates support wildcard patterns.

For example, to generate Control Sections for circuit breakers the cuttable expression could be:

	assettablename=eo_isolatingequipmentinstallation AND devicetype=circuitbreaker

And the accompanying upstream predicate would be:

	assettablename=eo_connectorsegment AND devicetype=busbar

In another system, the cuttable expression could be:

	assettablenames=*power_switch

And the accompanying upstream predicate would be:

	assettablenames=mv_busbar,hv_busbar
