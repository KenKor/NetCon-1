# Sections in general

A **section** is a group of connections that are linked together that has been created under a special *condition*.
By following the `FromId` and `ToId` properties, every connection in a section is linked.

## Sections in NetCon

In [[../../1 Introduction/Copyright and Usage|NetCon]], sections are created in a special way: Every section is also a connection.
So besides holding a group of connections, it also has connection properties.

Its `FromId` and `ToId` are derived from the connections that it contains:
* A section that contains a path of barriers or directed connections, has its `FromId` the the start NodeId that is found using Dijkstra-based section generation and the `ToId` is te end;
	* The barrier function and (bi)directionality are derived from their contents.
* A section that contains a group of other connections (so: no barriers and no directed connections), has for both its `FromId` and `ToId` the minimum node id in the group.
	* This section does not have a barrier state that can be switched (opened or closed) and it does not have unidirectional connections.
## Levels of sections
### First level section
Normal sections or first level sections contain [[../../6 Use/DataModel/NetCon Connection|connections]].

### Second level section
Super sections or second level sections contain [[Section#First level section|first level sections]] that contain [[../../6 Use/DataModel/NetCon Connection|connections]].

## Type of sections

On the [[./NetConTrace feature source|NetConTrace feature source]], you can configure if sections are generated or not.

The following section types are supported:

| Section Type                                           | Level | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Sectioning Condition                          | Sectioning Upstream Condition | Option               |

| Isolatable Section                                     | 1     | Smallest partition of the connection network. Sections are the smallest groups of connections that are 'isolated' independently. Note the sectioning is done independently from the barrier state; only the fact they can be use to bar is relevant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | IsBarrier OR UniDirectional                   | NA                            | IncludeUnfedSections |
| Operated Section                                       | 2     | Largest partition of the isolatable section network that shows how the network is currently being fed. Optionally an `CutExpression` can be provided so cut up the network into useful subsections, e.g. for MV to LV transformers, or HP to LW gas regulating stations, or pressure regulating installations for gas or transport-distribution-sectioning-valves for water. <br><br>As you can see from the condition (in the column at the right), the `CutExpression` is used in combination with an `AND` predicate and a `IsBarring OR UniDirectional` predicate which is hardcoded an cannot be omitted.<br><br>If no `CutExpression` is provided, the operated sections include the source and everything it is currently feeding, which may result in quite large sections.<br><br>Note that every operated section knows it down-streams operated sections. | IsBarring OR UniDirectional AND CutExpression | NA                            |                      |
| [[./Sections/Control or NetCongestion Section\|Control Section]] | 2     | Partition of isolatable section network that denote how the network is controlled. Typically, those are sections departing from a station that are feeding a part of the network. The sections are formed by checking which barriers are downstream from a station, as indicated for example by busbar-assets (or a regulating installation, or an asset hierarchy containing a station, etc.)<br><br>The optional `UpstreamExpression` is a predicate that should always match connections that define the controlling unit. In the previous example those are busbars for electricity,<br><br>Note that every control section knows it down-streams operated sections.                                                                                                                                                                                             | IsBarring OR UniDirectional AND CutExpression | UpstreamExpression            |                      |
| Custom Section                                         | 2     | Additional sections that can be used when the need arises. No particular upfront interpretation is intended. Use of an upstream expression is optional.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | IsBarring OR UniDirectional AND CutExpression | UpstreamExpression            | BlockExpression      |

Note there is a subtle difference in meaning between is `IsBarrier` (it can be used to bar, but it may be conducting now) and `IsBarring` (it is blocking the commodity in the current state).

The options used above have the following meaning:

| Option               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IncludeUnfedSections | Default is false. If set to true, then isolatable sections will be generated for connections that cannot be connected to a source. Note that connections that can be fed to the network by changing the barrier states, are always included in sections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| CutExpression        | Predicate expresssion that evaluates to true for connections with assets that split the sections, or false otherwise. If false, the resulting section will behave like a node (`FromId` = `ToID`) and if true it will behave like a path (`FromId` != `ToId`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| UpstreamExpression   | Predicate expression that evaluates to true for assets that are upstream from the barrier and denote a controlling unit.  For example, the first circuit-breaker switch after a busbar will start a new control section, and subsequent switching equipment does not. Circuit breakers upstream from the busbar will not have their own control section, but are part of another (upstream) control section that belongs to the other upstream controlling barrier (that is the upstream circuitbreaker). |
| BlockExpression      | Expression that is evaluate on connections and if any match is found will rule out the entire isolatable section from participating in the higher order section network.<br><br>For example, `assettablename=pl*` may be used to rule out any sections that contain any public lighting assets.<br>Likewise, `NOT assettablename=hv,mv*`will rule out any sections that do not contain high voltage or medium voltage assets.                                                                             |
