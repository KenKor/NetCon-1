# Terminal

A terminal is a connection that connects a connection representing a line asset with a (self-loop) connection representing a point asset.
When during the extraction terminals are inserted, new node ids are generated that will stay the same ever since.
Those static node ids are needed e.g. on export to a flow calculation or CIM model.
