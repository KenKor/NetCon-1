You can do amazing things with NetCon, like improving the data quality of your network, alleviating NetCongestion, realising a digital twin, etc.

#todo
This page needs to be improved and describe more about the use cases.

Spatial Eye is set to solve the business cases below using the NetCon model or work with customers and partners to do so. Besides the business cases mentioned here, numerous others are possible. You are welcome to build your own solutions on top of the NetCon model, as long as you acquire a license for it.

| Business Case| Available      | Purpose |
| ------------ | ---------      | ------- |
| Data Quality | yes            | Increase data quality of the registration of assets so the information suffices to support the companies business processes. |
| Exchange     | yes            | Propagate network connectivity information. |
| Calculation  | yes            | Feed flow calculation programs with network assets, usage statistics. The network is adapted to the consuming program. Examples: Gaia, Vision, PowerFactory, Synergy, Infoworks, Symbuild, PowerGridModel. |
| CIM to ADMS  | contact us     | Daily feed to the ADMS with current and commissioned network assets, including schematics, following the CIM standard. |
| History I    | yes | Fault analysis on historized networks (time travel and scenarios). RiscÂ based asset management. |
| History II   | todo | Detailed smart grid fault analysis after huge blackout by automated switching systems. |
| Design I     | in progress    | Envisioning, planning, and designing network extensions. Online collaboration environment. Insight in future timeline with design repository. |
| Design II    | in progress    | Compute impact. Using 'as built,' and 'as designed network' together as one to perform flow calculation for capacity and service values for newly built or upgraded networks. Determine bottlenecks to tackle. |
| Prediction   | research       | Aggregating smart meter & IoT data to build predicative models for production / consumption loads using ML/AI. Aggregating to DSO/TSO usage. |
| Outages I    | in progress    | Outage reporting, map, resolution times communication. |
| Outages II   | in progress    | Outage fault analysis, impact analysis, compensation payout, KPI monitoring. |
| KPI and reporting | in progress    | Best/worst serviced customer, best/worst Control, Customer Minutes Lost, SAIDI, SAIFI, CAIFI, sensitivity calculations. |
| OTDR & Inspection Trace | in progress | Trace out on a single path stopping at a certain cost. Find cable breaks or wall corrosion. |
| Touch Safety | in progress | Also known as dynamic security assessment. Safety computations (current depending on impedance) to check fuse values. This requires 'Calculation.' |
| Energy theft | todo | Combine endpoint and midpoint calculations to detect losses. |
| Network Dynamics | todo | Determining network capacity, safety, quality on the fly or periodically for parts of the network. Scenario / capacity planning. |
