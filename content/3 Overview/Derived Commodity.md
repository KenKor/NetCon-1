# Derived Commodity

In the asset registration, it is not always clear - when dealing with asset records and their directly related records - what the direct commodity and its details are.

When the network is directionalized on flow, missing commodities will be derived.
So, reasoning from the source, if a network element transport 'MV:50000:ABCN', and the next network element does not have a commodity, it will be derived to be MV:50000:ABCN as well.
