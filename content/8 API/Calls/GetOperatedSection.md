# API GetOperatedSection

The API Call `get-operated-section` retrieves all connectivity information for the [[../../5 Configuration/Sectioning and Tracing/Sections/Operated Sections|operated sections]] of the matching start connections.
The operated section is the part of the network that connected together by all connections and the [[../../3 Overview/Barrier or Operational State|Barrier]]s that are conducting, possibly separated by [[CommodityNet|CommodityNet]] or something similar.

If the search parameters are specified as wildcards, many matching records can be retrieved. Cap this my specifying [[../Parameters/MaxResults|MaxResults]].

If no parameters are provided, the connections of the operated sections of the [[../../3 Overview/Sources|Sources]] (see also [[../Results/Connection Or Path Results/Role|Role]]) in the network are retrieved.

| [[../Parameters/ConnectionIds\|ConnectionIds]]                 | long[]  | false | A list of unique identifier of a connections in the network. Every Id matches exactly one NetConConnection. If this parameter is provided, other match parameters are ignored, since they have no added value in specifying a connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [[../Parameters/AssetTableNamePattern\|AssetTableNamePattern]] | string  | false | Name of the asset table in the NetConConnection table. It may contain [[Wildcards|Wildcards]] if you want to search more than one table. If this parameter is kept empty (no name and no pattern), it will change the interpretation of the [[AssetId|AssetId]] parameter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[../Parameters/AssetIds\|AssetIds]]                           | long[]  | false | A list of AssetIds of one or more of the NetConConnections that must be matched exactly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [[../Parameters/CustomAssetIdPattern\|CustomAssetIdPattern]]   | string  | false | The string that matches the CustomAssetId of one or more of the NetConConnections exactly or by [[wildcard|wildcard]] pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[../Parameters/LabelPattern\|LabelPattern]]                   | string  | false | The string or pattern that matches the Label of the NetConConnection, if this was provided. For example: "circuitbreaker:1234" or "circuitbreaker*" or "123456789-*".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[../Parameters/AssetHierarchyPattern\|AssetHierarchyPattern]] | string  | false | [[NetConQL - Specification|NetConQL - Specification]] expression for AssetHierarchy properties, for example `substation.id=3,4 OR installation.id=17`. If enrichment is used, for other properties may be added such as substation.name, and the expression could be `substation.name=*FIELDS OR installation.id=17` which will match any substation whose name ends in FIELDS or has installation.id=17.                                                                                                   |
| [[../Parameters/SpecificationPattern\|SpecificationPattern]]   | string  | false | [[NetConQL - Specification|NetConQL - Specification]] expression to query asset's specification information. See also [[specification|specification]]. For example `id=789` , or for example `protection_material.id=789 AND core.id=3`. If enrichment has been applied, also things such as `core_material=CU` or `auxilary_cores>0` can be used.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[../Parameters/CommodityPattern\|CommodityPattern]]           | string  | false | [[NetConQL - Specification|NetConQL - Specification]] expression pattern to match [[commodity|commodity]] properties, which are net, function and details. For example `net=hv` matches high voltage, where `net=mv,lv` matches medium and low voltage. Also, `function>=10000` matches any commodity, 10.000 volts or higher. Furthermore, `details=ABCN` matches anything for subnetwork, any function and phases A,B, C as well N need to be present, and similarly `details=ABC*` has the neutral phase optional. |
| [[../Parameters/PatternAsRegex\|PatternAsRegex]]               | boolean | false | Changes all pattern behavior for the pattern parameters in this API call only. True means each patterns are regexes and false they are [[Wildcards|Wildcards]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [[../Parameters/MaxResults\|MaxResults]]                       | integer | false | Maximum number of results you want to retrieve, 0 if you want to provide none.This can be used to avoid overflow in the receiving application if very large results are produced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[../Parameters/IncludeGeoms\|IncludeGeoms]]                   | boolean | false | If false (default and faster), no geometries are returned. This is much faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[../Parameters/MergeGeoms\|MergeGeoms]]                       | boolean | false | If false (default) no additional geometries are retrieved. If true, one set of geometries is retrieved for all points in the result and one set for the lines (multi curve). This saves a lot of overhead in the result and can be convenient for highlighting in the receiving application.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [[../Parameters/GeomsAsArea\|GeomsAsArea]]                     | boolean | false | If false (default) no area geometry is returned. If true, one area geometry is returned (multi polygon) which is a buffer around all points and lines in a single geometry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
