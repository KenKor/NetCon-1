# API TraceOut

The API Call `trace-out` will use the start criteria to retrieve matching connections to start from and determine all shortest [[../Results/Search Or Trace Results/Paths (Result)|Paths (Result)]] to connections that match yield criteria. Block criteria will be avoided during this trace.

If no parameters are provided, the [[../../3 Overview/Sources|Sources]] (see also [[../Results/Connection Or Path Results/Role|Role]]) in the network are used as start. Similarly, if no yield parameters are provided, shortest paths to [[Consumers|Consumers]] are retrieved, see [[../Results/Connection Or Path Results/Role|Role]].

Note that all provided start and yield parameters will be used for the match as a logical `and`, apart from the `StartAssetId` which will overrule any `StartCustomAssetId` provided. Likewise for `StopAssetId` and `StopCustomAssetId`.

Block parameters will be used as a logical `or`: if any of those parameters is matched to a connection, that connection is blocked from being used in the trace result. The exception is that `BlockAssetTableNameWildCard`, this will be used as a logical `and` with the asset ids provided.

If the search parameters are specified as wildcards, many matching records can be retrieved.
