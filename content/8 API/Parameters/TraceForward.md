title: TraceForward
description: Normally, the trace-path goes against the direction of the network, typically to find a source. For unidirectional connections, that means it goes from [[ToId|ToId]] to [[FromId|FromId]], and the trace retrieves only unidirectional neighbors leading 'from' are retrieved. If TraceForward is set to true, the opposite direction is followed, and only unidirectional neighbors leading from [[ToId|ToId]] are retrieved. Typically, you do not need to specify this parameter.
