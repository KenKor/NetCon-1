# EnrichAssetInformation

Type of: _boolean_
Unique: __

This parameter became redundant. If enrichment data has been configured, it can be queried and will be returned.

Old function: If true, then the assets in the trace results will be enriched with additional information about the asset, if so specified in the [configuration](EnrichAssetInformation.md##asset-enrichment). The default is false (much faster).
