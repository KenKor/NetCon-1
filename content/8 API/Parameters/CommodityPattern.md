description: "[[NetConQL - Specification|NetConQL - Specification]] expression pattern to match [[commodity|commodity]] properties, which are net, function and details. For example `net=hv` matches high voltage, where `net=mv,lv` matches medium and low voltage. Also, `function>=10000` matches any commodity, 10.000 volts or higher. Furthermore, `details=ABCN` matches anything for subnetwork, any function and phases A,B, C as well N need to be present, and similarly `details=ABC*` has the neutral phase optional."
