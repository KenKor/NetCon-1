# Viewing Connectivity


It is good practice to share a viewing application to see NetCon connectivity data, either by using the desktop or server. It is many times faster to see and understand the data graphically than in tabular form. Hence, much time has been dedicated in creating a viewer.seProject.

Typically the connectivity data is viewed:

- Classified from its origin, e.g. asset_table_name and or manifold. These can also be used in combination with business filter in the desktop tool;
- Classified by isolated section;
- Classified by operated section;
- Upstream and downstream flow indication.

#ToDo Insert examples of each seen in the viewer here.
Also, put in some examples of the web viewer.

Example of flow of an electric network

Example of flow of an electric network. The flow is computed from the source of the commodity and will change .

Two types of configurations can be created:

- For viewing the NetCon data as stored in the database;
- For interacting with the NetCon data as used in Trace expressions and the Trace API.
