# Property Graph - Introduction

In the NetCon graph representation of the network, everything is a property. Hence, the connection's Id, FromNodeId, ToNodeId, but also its Role, Barrier, Status, are properties.

Commodity, Specification and AssetHierachy are hierarchical lists of properties.
In particular Specification and AssetHierachy are multilevel property-trees that can be enriched with spec or type information (e.g. type information for main or auxilary cores), or information about structural components (installation, station, plant).

Last but not least, every Connection can be enriched with additional properties.
