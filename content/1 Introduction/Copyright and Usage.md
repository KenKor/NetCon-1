# Copyright and Usage
© Spatial Eye 2022-2024

In order to build the NetCon© data model and populate it with data, you need to have a valid `Spatial Eye NetCon`, or `Spatial Eye Spatial Warehouse with NetCon` or `GE GeoSpatial Analysis Spatial Warehouse with NetCon` license.

You are allowed to use the NetCon structure and all its contained data for your own purposes without buying additional licenses throughout the enterprise. For example, it is possible to build your own software applications on top of it. Note that Spatial Eye software is especially suitable for doing this, and we are continuously implementing new user requests.

You are not allowed to alter the NetCon data model. It is maintained centrally to ensure compatibility between all applications that function on top of NetCon, and has an option to be enriched dynamically. If changes are required, they are addressed via the normal GE or Spatial Eye change process. In addition, users of the NetCon model can form user groups to manage their common stake. Spatial Eye facilitates this in the GSA User Community.

You are not allowed to create derivative models that are not directly or indirectly populated from the NetCon model (for which you need a valid license). In other words, you are not allowed to create competing solutions using this software and its data structure as a source.
