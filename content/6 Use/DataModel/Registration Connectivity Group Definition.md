# Registration Connectivity Group Definition

Old name: Manifold Definition

List of the source systems topology interaction groups. All objects with the same group, which is called a **connectivity rule group** or **manifold**, can topologically interact, i.e. share nodes and links. The definition of the table contents is standard and should not be altered.
