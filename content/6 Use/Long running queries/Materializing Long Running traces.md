For isolatable, operated, congestion and custom sections the trace information is available as feature source so it can be persisted.

For congestion sections, in addition, also a fully materialized trace is available having all possible upstream and downstream combinations. With this, you can find all downstream sections in one go for a particular place in the network. That is handy to do aggregates within the database or viewer applications (of course the [[../../8 API/NetCon API Calls|NetCon API Calls]] will also support aggregates, with the advantage it can be done on the dynamic network.
